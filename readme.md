# Scapegoat-Scalafix
## Scalafix implementation of Scapegoat linter for Scala 3

## Versions:

* **Scala 3**:
[![maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.dedis/scapegoat-scalafix_3)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.dedis/scapegoat-scalafix_3)


* **Scala 2.13**:
[![maven](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.dedis/scapegoat-scalafix_2.13)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.dedis/scapegoat-scalafix_2.13)

## Description
This project is a Scalafix implementation of the Scapegoat linter for Scala 3. It contains a set of rules that can be run on Scala code to detect potential issues and bad practices. The rules are based on the Scapegoat linter for Scala 2, but have been adapted to work with Scalafix and Scala 3.

For now, this project has 52 rules but more are being worked on.

## Installation

To install the rules, simply add the following to your `build.sbt` file:
```
ThisBuild / scalafixDependencies += "io.github.dedis" %% "scapegoat-scalafix" % "1.1.2"
```

**The rules are compatible with Scala 2.13 and Scala 3 (tested for Scala 3.3.1).**

To check proper installation, run `scalafix OptionGet` which should execute the OptionGet rule and succeed if everything went well.

### Note
You might need to add the following lines:
```
inThisBuild(
    List(
        semanticdbEnabled := true,
        semanticdbVersion := scalafixSemanticdb.revision
    )
)
```

This is necessary to enable the SemanticDB, which is required for the rules to work. Only add these lines if SemanticDB is not already enabled in the `build.sbt`.

## Usage

After installation, to run any of these rules, simply call:
```
sbt scalafix RuleName
```

You can also create a `.scalafix.conf` file and enable rules in them. Here is an example with all of the rules enabled:
```
rules = [
    ArraysInFormat,
    CatchNpe,
    ComparingFloatingTypes,
    EitherGet,
    EmptyInterpolatedString,
    IllegalFormatString,
    ImpossibleOptionSizeCondition,
    IncorrectNumberOfArgsToFormat,
    IncorrectlyNamedExceptions,
    LonelySealedTrait,
    MapGetAndGetOrElse,
    NanComparison,
    OptionGet,
    OptionSize,
    StripMarginOnRegex,
    TryGet,
    UnsafeContains,
    UnsafeStringContains,
    UnsafeTraversableMethods,
    AvoidSizeEqualsZero,
    AvoidSizeNotEqualsZero,
    CatchException,
    CatchExceptionImmediatelyRethrown,
    CatchFatal,
    CatchThrowable,
    CollectionIndexOnNonIndexedSeq,
    CollectionNegativeIndex,
    CollectionPromotionToAny,
    ComparisonWithSelf,
    ConstantIf,
    DuplicateImport,
    EmptyFor,
    EmptyIfBlock,
    EmptyMethod,
    EmptySynchronizedBlock,
    EmptyTryBlock,
    EmptyWhileBlock,
    FinalizerWithoutSuper,
    LooksLikeInterpolatedString,
    MethodReturningAny,
    NullAssignment,
    NullParameter,
    RepeatedCaseBody,
    RepeatedIfElseBody,
    SwallowedException,
    UnnecessaryConversion,
    UnreachableCatch,
    UnusedMethodParameter,
    VarCouldBeVal,
    VariableShadowing,
    WhileTrue,
    InterpolationToString,
]
```

With this, you can simply run all the rules in the configuration file by calling:
```
sbt scalafix
```

## Usage

To run the rules, simply execute the following command:
```
sbt scalafix
```

## Modifying and adding rules

Scalafix provides some documentation on how to write rules, following their [tutorial](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix/docs/developers/tutorial.html) is recommended.

To add a rule, you need to
* Create rule test cases in the `input/src/main/scala/fix` folder
* Create the rule in the `rules/src/main/scala/fix` folder
* Add the rule to the list of rules in `rules/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/scalafix.v1.ScalafixRule`


Output folder is ignored since this is a linter.

## Testing

To test the rules run:
```
sbt test
```

## Publishing

To publish the rules, follow the tutorial on the Scalafix website.
In short you need to:
* Generate a gpg key to sign
* Publish the GPG key to https://keyserver.ubuntu.com
* Create an account on Maven central (see [tutorial](https://central.sonatype.org/register/central-portal/#choosing-a-namespace))
* Verify namespace access for io.github.dedis (see [tutorial](https://central.sonatype.org/register/namespace/#create-an-account))
* Modify the version in `build.sbt`
* Run `sbt publishSigned`
* ZIP the `target/sonatype-staging/VERSION/io/` folder (only include starting from io) and publish it to Maven:
simply click "Publish Component" on Sonatype, set the name to "io.github.dedis:scapegoat-scalafix:VERSION" and upload the ZIP file.

_Don't forget to update the version in the installation section_
