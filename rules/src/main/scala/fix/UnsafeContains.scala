      will notably give us the inferred type. If the type is a UnionType, we know that the contains method is called on an
      element which doesn't have the collection type (because UnionType contains two types).
      However, synthetics don't have the same amount of information as the semantic document, it only appears when
      necessary. For example the code blocks, or class definition will not appear if there is no need for the compiler to
      add information. This means that we cannot directly build a patch from the synthetics as we will miss many empty
      patches. Instead, we will collect the positions of the synthetics that we want to lint, and then we will look at the
      tree to see if the positions are in the tree. If they are, we will lint them.
